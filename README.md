My Web Dev Adventure

The man, the myth, and the legend never stops learning.

I am Praveen, a regular human. My first experience with code was with making a turtle draw patters using Logo in thrid grade, shout-out Pine Crest! I saw Adobe PageMaker at work in eigth grade, not knowing what it represented. My next brush with programming was two semesters of C++ in tenth grade, however a hacked togeather private LAN matches of playing Unreal Tournament with the school network could not pull my attention back. 

I went on to the business route, set on absorbing as much as I could with expectation all the lessons would come in handy. Helping family and my church youth group, I knew how to get around MS Frontpage and FreeFTP  but never stopped to learn CSS or customize XHTML very effectively. 

In 2008, even briefly starting a multi-media & web design shop focused on Drupal 4.7/5/6, attended DrupalCon '08 Boston. I didn't learn to code, I mostly immersed myself learning the backend and how a CMS and opensource community collaborated. I was a lurker studying how I could fit in. Before I got any closer to code beyond gathering user stories from Clients, our design shop closed, and my attention returned to networking & hardware. 

I've lingered in middle-management, from healthcare to e-discovery litigation support and now I want a put my familiarity with web technology to work, get back to that fun time puzziling pieces togeather in to a complete project. Perhaps I can connect my new skills with current skills with project management into DevOps, but that well off.

In the weeks to come I plan on using resources from theodinproject.com, freecodecamp.org, and even codecombat.com to dive in. GitHub will be my central log as I document and hold myself accountable as I persue #100DaysOfCode as a challenge.
